        <h3>I taught myself to code by <br>
            making 180 websites in 180 days!</h3>

        <p>From April 1st, 2013 to September 27, 2013, I made one website a day, every single day as a learn to code project. Along the way, I published all my code publicly on <a href="https://github.com/jendewalt/jennifer_dewalt">GitHub</a> and wrote a <a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com">blog</a> post to accompany each website. I started with just a little html and css, but by the end I was making dynamic, interactive apps using Javascript, Ruby on Rails and Node.js.</p>

        <p>Check out this <a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/62998082815/after-180-websites-im-ready-to-start-the-rest-of">blog post</a> to read more about the project.</p>

        <p>Since I finished the 180 Websites project, I've been continuing to develop my coding skill set. Immediately after the 180 Websites project, I worked on <a href="http://yumhacker.com">YumHacker</a>, a restaurant discovery website. I tackled YumHacker solo, making everything from backend to the front as well as exploring other product development issues like marketing, SEO and business relationships. YumHacker's built with a Rails API on the backend serving a Backbone front end as a single page app.</p>

        <p>Recently, I've been working on a side project called <a href="https://zube.io">Zube</a> using Node.js, MongoDB and Backbone. We're still in alpha but you can sign up on the landing page I'll let you know when we go to beta!</p>
